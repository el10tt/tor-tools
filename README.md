Well this is just an tor related's tool kit. I pretend to collect some interesting tools for privacity and anonymity purposes.
I pretend to include here:
- Reverse shells over tor: Since they are very useful and not very common to find on internet.
- TorHost: An simple script that I made for manage ephemeral hidden services (mainly for listener purposes, but u can do whatever u want with it).
