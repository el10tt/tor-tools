Well this is just an tor related's tool kit. I pretend to collect some interesting tools for privacity and anonymity purposes.
I pretend to include here:
- TorHost: An simple script that I made for manage ephemeral hidden services (mainly for listener purposes, but u can do whatever u want with it).
- Torete: An script to manage tor connections.

# Torhost.sh
Is an easy way to create and manage ephemeral hidden services for do whatever u want to do. It's mainly thinked for listener purposes but you know.
By default it uses port 80. Can be upgraded to establish TLS conecction but is not my priority right now. Tested on Debian based systems (Kali, Debian, Parrot) but might work in systemd based systems.

### Options
- install - Torhost will check if u have an hidden service set up on /etc/tor/torrc, if not, it will set up for you.
- start - Start your hidden service.
- stop - Stop your hidden service.
- change - Change hidden service hostname's and print the new one.
- check - Check the hostname of your hidden service.

#### Usage/Examples

```bash
sudo bash torhost.sh install
sudo bash torhost.sh check
```

# Torete
Torete is a simple script for manage your tor conecction, via transparent proxy generated by torsocks, this script must be run as root (not sudo).
This script has been tested on Debian, Kali, and Parrot, but can work on other systems.

### Options
- on - Enable torete's tor proxy.
- off - Disable torete's tor proxy.
- change - Change your tor relay to avoid IP ban, or whatever...

#### Usage/Examples

```bash
. torete on
. torete off
